### About Me

I am a graduate from the University of Michigan, where I studied Data Science in the School of Information. I have used data science to pique my interest in many different fields, including finance, politics, cyber security, advertising, and sports analytics. I am currently a cybersecurity data scientist at KPMG, where I use data analytics and machine learning to strengthen the cyber defense of companies I consult.
